        "According to common sense, the lowest temperature is also relatively high on the days with the high highest temperature in winter, so the absolute temperature difference between the highest temperature and the lowest temperature can be calculated. If this result tends to be stable on a daily basis, then my hypothesis is valid.The purpose of this comparison is to compare the minimum temperatures to the amount of snowfall. The comparison looks at all the days of 2017 where temperatures were freezing (32 degrees fahrenheit) or lower in State College, PA. Days with zero snow fall were included in the data set, as were days where the temperature min was 32 degrees fahrenheit."

We chose to show the difference in temperature for a better understanding of what we were trying to showcase."

Temperature as the vertical axis clearly describes the daily maximum temperature and temperature difference in December 2019, and uses a contrasting polyline to indicate changes. Because of these things the graph is both easy to comprehend and simple in design. We think that because everything on the graph was clear and the key is also clear the reader can quickly look at the graph and get a pretty good understanding of the topic that we landed on."

This makes this picture completely useless to intuitively and visually compare the maximum and minimum temperatures in December 2019. To compund on these things there is no key for the reader. Without a key it becomes very hard to understand what a graph is trying to showcase. The reader knows nothing about the circles themselves, what they are referring to, and how the two graphs relate to one another."

This graph does infact have a key. The difference here is that the key, and the symbols on the key and graph, are not easily distinguishable from one another. The reader has to spend a significant amount of time trying to comprehend what is in front of them. This graph is pretty funny to look at and because of that, we chose it as our ugly graph."
