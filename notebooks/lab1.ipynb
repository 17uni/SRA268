Days with zero snow fall were included in the data set, as were days where the temperature min was 32 degrees fahrenheit."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"yTXiFKAvnROj","colab_type":"text"},"source":["#### Sketch"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"VkMfxnEtsAcZ","colab_type":"text"},"source":["![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/17uni/sra268/master/sra268-lab1-image.PNG)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"l_XxhFlWnh11","colab_type":"text"},"source":["#### Conclusions"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"KTqYKnYOnzOi","colab_type":"text"},"source":["In conclusion, after observing the results of the study by looking at the graph, snowfall varries significantly for State College, PA. It has been determined that minimum temperature is most likely not the only variable for snow fall. A better comparison may need to include humidity as well. Humidity and temperature are two of the main varialbes in suitable conditions for snowfall."]}]}
