I thought this was a better way to show it because by default Tableau is not the most straightforward and easy thing to manipulate. If I could change a few things I would have changed how much white space is on the graph, gotten rid of the borders, and make it look nicer. I think that these additions would have made the graph better. But again, Tableau is not easy.\n"

I found it interesting to see it spike at the beginning then fall a little and bounce back and forth between about seventy and eighty five points. I was expecting a much larger number, with my limited knowledge of basketball. I think if I could add anything to this I would add the average loss points, also as a line.

Honestly I want to try to make a bracket with this just to see how well it does. The downside of this graph is that it shows some boxes without labels and adding those would be nice. Overall this is probably my favorite graph of lab two."
